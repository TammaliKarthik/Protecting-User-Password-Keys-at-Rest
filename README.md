# Protecting-User-Password-Keys-at-Rest
This project focuses on developing a secure application for file encryption, specifically designed to protect user password keys at rest (i.e., when stored on the disk). The application utilizes advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure that user passphrases and encryption keys are securely managed and not stored in plain text.
